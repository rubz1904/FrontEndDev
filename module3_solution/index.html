        <p class="text_content">Seattle is home to thousands of businesses, both large and small but for right now, we're giving some
            love to the former. A handful of large companies like Starbucks, Nordstrom and Alaskan Airlines got
            their start in Seattle but today, a new class of major tech companies are stepping up as employment
            hubs in the city. According to Statista, nearly 11% of Seattle’s workforce is employed in tech. With
            that in mind, we've compiled a list of some of Seattle's largest tech and tech-enabled companies for
            anyone looking to jumpstart their research on the city's tech scene. While this list is far from
            definitive, we've narrowed it down to only companies headquartered in Seattle with at least 200
            local employees in our database. Seattle is home to thousands of businesses, both large and small but for right now, we're giving some
